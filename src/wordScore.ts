/**
 * WHAT A GOMOJI WORD SCORES, won or lost. John, 2026-09-25: "lost words
 * would give you more than 0 for getting some GREEN and some yellow. like time
 * gives you some points, number of guesses, number of green, sooner the better
 * green, yellows, number of yellows, etc." and "0 points is only possible for
 * never hitting even one letter".
 *
 * Every letter of the word is worth something the first time it is found, and
 * more the sooner: a guess's WEIGHT is the rows that were still to come when
 * it was made, so the first row of six weighs 6 and the last weighs 1.
 *
 *  - PLACED: a letter in its place, 10 × the weight of the guess that first
 *    put it there.
 *  - ELSEWHERE: a letter of the word found but never placed, 4 × the weight of
 *    the guess that first showed it.
 *  - FOUND: the word itself, 10 for every place of every guess the board
 *    gives (`foundBonus`: 300 for five letters and six guesses, 450 for nine),
 *    and 25 for every guess left unused.
 *  - SPEED: a word found inside a minute, 50, one fewer for every six seconds
 *    after that, nothing after six minutes. The browser's clock, as every solo
 *    time here is; a lost word earns none, or giving up fast would pay.
 *
 * So a word with no letter ever found scores 0 and nothing else does, and any
 * word found is worth more than any word lost, however many guesses the level
 * gives (`layout.ts`). A lost word never had every letter in place in one
 * guess, so at best all but one went in on the first row and the last on the
 * second: 10 × (letters × guesses − 1). A word found on its last row has every
 * place (10 × letters) and the bonus (10 × letters × guesses), which is more
 * (`wordScore.test.ts` holds it at every size and level). Everything but the time is read from the
 * guesses, which the server has checked, so the server works it out itself.
