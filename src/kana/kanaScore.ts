/**
 * WHAT A KANA WORD SCORES, won or lost, on English's scale (`wordScore`) so
 * the two boards read alike. A guess's weight is the rows still to come.
 *
 *  - PLACED: a place first played plain green, 10 × that guess's weight.
 *  - ELSEWHERE: a kana of the word never placed but found another way — orange,
 *    or green with an arrow — 4 × the weight of the guess that first showed it.
 *  - COLUMN: a place never found either way whose column a yellow once named,
 *    1 × that guess's weight: it says which column, not which kana.
 *  - FOUND and SPEED: as English — the word 10 a place for every guess the
 *    board gives (`foundBonus`) and 25 a guess left, and up to 50 for a word
 *    found inside a minute.
 *
 * A lost word never had every place plain green in one guess, so it comes to
 * at most 10 × (kana × guesses − 1), and a word found on its last row to more
 * than that (`kanaScore.test.ts`, at every size and count of guesses). Only a
 * word with no kana and no column found scores 0.
