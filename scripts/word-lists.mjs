/**
 * WRITES THE GOMOJI LISTS from SCOWL, so the lists in the repository are
 * a machine's output that anybody can make again, never a hand-kept table.
 *
 *   curl -sL -o scowl.tar.gz https://downloads.sourceforge.net/wordlist/scowl-2020.12.07.tar.gz
 *   tar xzf scowl.tar.gz
 *   node scripts/word-lists.mjs scowl-2020.12.07/final
 *
 * SCOWL (Spell Checker Oriented Word Lists, Kevin Atkinson) is under a
 * permissive notice that asks only that its copyright notice travel with the
 * lists; the notice is written into the file this makes. Its sizes run from 10
 * (the commonest words) to 95 (the rarest): the answers come from sizes 10 to
 * 35, the easy answers from 10 and 20 alone, and what may be guessed from sizes
 * up to 70. English and American spellings both, lower case a–z only, so no
 * proper names, abbreviations or possessives.
 *
 * An answer is a word anybody would be glad to see. Plurals and past tenses
 * whose stem is itself a word are left out of the answers (a puzzle whose
 * answer is "cats" is a puzzle about "cat"), as are slurs, vulgarity,
 * anything sexual, drugs and insults a player could read as aimed at them, by
 * the list below. All of them may still be GUESSED: the allowed list is every
 * word, because refusing a real word is the one thing a word puzzle must not
 * do.
 *
 * SCOWL is a real dictionary, so a word here is English; any language Gomoji
 * adds later takes its words from a real dictionary of that language too, never
 * from a frequency count alone (`word-lists-fr-de.mjs` says why).
