 *
 * John, 2026-09-26: a pop-culture Gomoji "built as a curated corpus, not a
 * script that invents 2,000 per length: each word with its category shown as
 * the clue, checked true and family-safe… deduplicated, quality over count…
 * guesses accepted from the dictionary lists and the corpus, lengths 3-7".
 *
 * So the ANSWERS are `scripts/pop-corpus.txt`, a person's list, each word with
 * its category; this checks every one of them — a to z only, three to seven
 * letters, none on the list of words never hidden, none twice — and refuses to
 * write anything if one fails. A word under two categories is kept under the
 * first, and said so.
 *
 * The GUESSES are the English dictionary's words of the length and the
 * corpus's. Four to six letters are Gomoji's own lists already
 * (`words.en.data.ts`); three and seven are written here from SCOWL, sizes up
 * to 70 as Gomoji's are, into a file of their own that is fetched only when a
 * three- or seven-letter puzzle is played (`loadPopGuesses`), so no other
 * Gomoji carries them.
 *
 * Both files are written; neither is edited by hand.
