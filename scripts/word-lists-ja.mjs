/**
 * WRITES THE KANA GOMOJI LISTS AND KUMIMOJI'S JAPANESE WORDS AND TILE MIX
 * from JMdict, so the lists in the repository are machine output anybody can
 * make again, never hand-kept tables. See docs/plans/other/WORD-04-kana.md.
 *
 *   curl -sL -o JMdict_e.gz http://ftp.edrdg.org/pub/Nihongo/JMdict_e.gz
 *   node scripts/word-lists-ja.mjs JMdict_e.gz
 *
 * JMdict is the Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group's
 * dictionary, under CC BY-SA 4.0 with EDRDG's own conditions
 * (https://www.edrdg.org/edrdg/licence.html, read 2026-09-25): the pages that
 * show its words say so, and the data is refreshed from the newest release at
 * least monthly — which is why this runs on a schedule
 * (.github/workflows/jmdict-refresh.yml) and writes the release date into the
 * file it makes. The list it makes is a derived work under the same licence.
 *
 * Every kana reading of 3, 4 or 5 kana may be guessed, folded to hiragana (ー
 * stays). The answers are the COMMONEST readings, ranked by a rule rather than
 * picked by hand, and about as many as English has (John, 2026-09-25: "a
 * programmatic way to narrow down words to best words… shouldn't be too much
 * larger than english"): easy the first 900 at each length, medium and hard the
 * first 2,000. The rank: words in the textbook-common list (ichi1) first; then
 * the newspaper frequency band (nf01 is the 500 commonest, nf02 the next 500),
 * with spec1 counted as band 12, gai1 as 16 and spec2 as 30; then more marks
 * before fewer; then kana order. A reading shared by several entries takes its
 * best. Left out of the answers: interjections, particles, conjunctions,
 * affixes, counters, auxiliaries and set phrases, anything JMdict marks vulgar,
 * derogatory, sensitive, archaic, obsolete or rare, irregular spellings, a word
 * starting with ー or a small kana, and the few below. A loanword (a katakana
 * reading with no kanji) counts only its ichi1, gai1 and newspaper marks: spec1
 * and spec2 alone mark English written in katakana (クレイジー, トレジャー,
 * ネイチャー), which may be guessed and is not yet a Japanese word to hide.
 *
 * JMdict is a real dictionary, so every word here is Japanese; any language
 * Gomoji adds later takes its words from a real dictionary of that language
 * too, never from a frequency count alone (`word-lists-fr-de.mjs` says why).
 *
 * Stored one character a kana, the words of one length run together with
 * nothing between them, one file a length: a 3-kana puzzle loads about fifty
 * kilobytes, where all three lists written out as kana would be over a megabyte.
