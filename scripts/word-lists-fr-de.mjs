/**
 * WRITES THE FRENCH AND GERMAN GOMOJI LISTS, so the lists in the repository
 * are a machine's output that anybody can make again, never a hand-kept table.
 * Modelled on `scripts/word-lists.mjs`, which does the same for English from
 * SCOWL.
 *
 * A REAL DICTIONARY DECIDES WHAT IS A WORD; the subtitles only say how common
 * one is. John, 2026-09-26, on a French puzzle whose answer was RUDD: "Why is
 * the French Word RUDD accepted??? what is wrong with our dictionary!?" — and
 * then "other languages might have this same problem, which is not
 * acceptable." These lists used to be a count of film subtitles alone, and
 * dubbed dialogue is full of English names and words, so RUDD, ROOD, AANG and
 * ALEC were French. ANY LANGUAGE ADDED LATER TAKES ITS WORDS FROM A REAL
 * DICTIONARY OF THAT LANGUAGE TOO; a frequency count may rank them, never
 * decide them.

 *
 * WHAT MAY BE GUESSED: every spelling of the length the dictionary has, less a
 * proper name or an abbreviation — refusing a real word is the one thing a
 * word puzzle must not do, and nothing else may be accepted. French: a
 * Lexique spelling that French books use, or that no corpus counts at all (so
 * "anya", which only film dialogue says, is not a word). German: any form in
 * the dictionary not tagged a name (EIG) or an abbreviation (ABK).
 *
 * WHAT MAY BE HIDDEN, from those the subtitles say (their 50,000 commonest
 * words), ranked by how common: for French by Lexique's own count of the word
 * as that word, since the subtitles count "juan" and "jules" as the names they
 * mostly are; for German by the subtitles.
 * - A WORD OF BOTH DICTIONARIES: Wiktionary must have it too, as a word of
 *   this language and not only a name, which leaves out the brands and names a
 *   dictionary carries unmarked ("lego", "ajax", "Volvo", "Rhein").
 * - A BASE FORM, as the dictionary says (its lemma): a noun as it is listed, a
 *   verb's infinitive, an adjective's plain form, never a plural or a
 *   conjugation. French folds its accents, so "aime" (loves) and "aimé"
 *   (beloved) are one spelling here: it is a base form only when its base
 *   readings are at least a quarter of how often the spelling is read and
 *   heard (`BASE_SHARE`). German: a noun made of an adjective ("die Neue",
 *   tagged SUB…:ADJ) is the adjective's inflection, not a base form, and a
 *   word the dictionary lists as a noun only is not one when it is also the
 *   plural of another noun ("Slums") or an adjective inflected ("Alte",
 *   "Freie"), which is how a reader takes it — at the cost of "Junge" and
 *   "Tiefe", which may still be guessed.
 * - A WORD OF THE LANGUAGE, NOT OF ENGLISH. A word English also spells (its
 *   Gomoji list) is hidden only when Wiktionary names where it came from in
 *   this language, and more of its senses came from elsewhere than from
 *   English: French "agent" (from Latin) and "chat" (the cat outweighs the
 *   online chat) stay, and a tie goes to English;
 *   "cool", "look", "Like" and "Song" may be guessed and are never the answer.
 *   Nor is a shared word Wiktionary has no entry for in this language ("team"
 *   in French, "head" and "push" in German) or gives no origin ("house",
 *   "code", "Aroma"): a shared word has to be shown to be this language's, and
 *   losing "code" as an answer costs less than hiding "house". It is still a
 *   word to guess. Comparing how often French books and films use a word, as
 *   this first did, held back "agent" and "bail" (films say them more) and let
 *   through "class" and "smart" (books say them too).
 * - French: read in French books (Lexique's `freqlivres` above nought), and not
 *   an onomatopoeia ("ahem", "argh").
 * - Not in `NOT_AN_ANSWER`: vulgarity, slurs, and the few words for a people a
 *   slur is most often made of, which are fine to guess and not an answer.
 *
 * FRENCH folds accents to plain letters (é→E, ç→C…), as French Wordle clones
 * do, so the grid and keyboard are the AZERTY 26 letters; a word carrying œ or
 * æ has no plain-letter spelling and is left out entirely.
 *
 * GERMAN keeps Ä, Ö and Ü as letters of their own — QWERTZ has keys for them —
 * and a word carrying ß is left out, the way French leaves out œ and æ.
